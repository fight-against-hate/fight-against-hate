**For when people try to claim puberty blockers are harmful:**

There is *extensive* research about long term use of puberty blockers, and they have overwhelmingly been shown to be very gentle and safe.

This treatment isn't just used for trans youth - it has been the standard treatment for kids with precocious puberty for decades. Most kids with precocious puberty don't have any underlying medical condition, their early development is just an extreme variation of normal development, but it would still cause serious psychological damage to start puberty at the age of, say, 6. This treatment has no long term side effects; it just puts puberty on hold. Stop treatment, and puberty picks up where it left off.
