#  Transgender and LGBT Health

* Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) individuals are those who are unique in terms of either sexuality, gender identity or both. A transgender person is somebody whose gender does not align with their birth sex. A lesbian is a female who is attracted to other females. A gay person is a male attracted to other males. A bisexual individual is somebody who is attracted to more than one gender.
* Gender identity and sex are separate. Sex refers to the biological characteristics an individual had at birth, while gender identity refers to one’s understanding of oneself in terms of subjective masculine, feminine or androgynous traits and characteristics. While gender identity is often correlated with sex, this is not always the case, for example, transgender people have a gender identity differing from their birth sex.
* LGBT people have an elevated risk of suicide, suicidal ideation and severe psychological distress. As I will discuss, the solution is not to judge, denigrate or discriminate against LGBT people, but to empathise, understand and accept them.

## Mental Health of Sexual and Gender Minorities

* Transgender and gender diverse youth are at a significantly increased risk of self-harm, eating disorders, depression and suicidal ideation and attempts in addition to higher psychiatric morbidity.

## Discrimination Still Persists

* 70% of transgender and gender non-conforming patients and 56% of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) patients reported experiencing discrimination from a healthcare provider.

* The majority of transgender people reporting having had experienced discrimination, with many experiencing severely harmful discrimination as bad as forcing them to drop out of school.

## Gender Transition and a Supportive Environment

* A meta-analysis of 55 studies on the effects of transitioning on mental health was conducted. It found that 51 of the studies indicated positive impacts of transitioning on transgender wellbeing while the other 4 had “mixed or null findings”. No studies indicated any harmful effects of gender transition on mental health.

## "Biology tho" "Unnatural tho"

* [Sex is not a strict binary](https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/164FE5CE-FBA6-493F-B9EA84B04830354E_source.jpg), as outliers exist which demonstrate that sex goes beyond genitalia. Why can’t the same be said about outliers in terms of gender identity, such as transgender individuals?

* Referring back to previously mentioned unilateral support from medical associations and authoritative boards, the major consensus from the western medical community is that **gender is separate from biological sex**.
* Leaning more on the philosophy side. Even if something is biologically unfounded, what is the moral relevance? If support and transitioning indicate positive outcomes, what reason is there to restrict others? For example, if it is okay to discriminate against others on the basis of biology, is it acceptable to assault, abuse and harass a hypothetical human who had slightly different biology separate from what would be seen in the human genome? If not, what is the morally relevant trait differentiating a “semi-human” from a transgender person making it acceptable to discriminate against one on the basis of biology, but not the other?

## The Desistance Myth

* The act of detransitioning is grossly misrepresented by conservative media. Only 8% of trans people detransitioning at some point, and of those, 62% stated their detransition was temporary and they went back to living life as a transgender individual. Of those who detransitioned, only 5% did so because they realised it was not for them. Calculating this, this means that 0.4% of transgender individuals detransition and their reasoning for doing so was because transitioning wasn’t for them.

* Commonly cited papers that contradict the findings of the USTS survey were authored or co-authored by those who had histories of transphobic actions (author bias) and defined gender dysphoria incredibly loosely. One of the most widely cited studies (The Steensma Study) neglected to consider the reasons for detransitioning, had tiny sample sizes, baselessly assumed that all who did not respond to the follow-up questionnaires had desisted and **many of the “desisters” were not even diagnosed with gender dysphoria**.

## Dispelling Other Common Myths

* People often mistakenly say that children raised by same-sex parents fare worse than those who are not. This is not backed by science and there exist many studies and meta-analyses of child function in terms of mental health and schoolwork and finds that they are not in any way disadvantaged and may even experience benefits in terms of school-work.

* Transgender children are confident and firm in their identity and self-identify with a high degree of confidence and tend to prefer the clothing, toys and friendships typically associated with their gender identity. They are not “confused” about their identity.
