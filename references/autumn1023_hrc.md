# Why I Removed The Human Rights Campaign

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) has a very troubled history with trans
rights.  From the [2007 Employment Non-Discrimination Act
debacle,](https://web.archive.org/web/20080409024947/http://www.gaycitynews.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18883568&BRD=2729&PAG=461&dept_id=568864&rfi=6)
to endorsements of candidates [who back away from supporting trans
children,](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2021/09/17/mcauliffe-school-boards-should-make-own-decisions-on-trans-students-policy/)
to elevating to president (and recently firing) a man who was willing
throw _all women_ under the bus to cover up [sexual harrassment
investigations,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cuomo-harassment-allegations--advocacy-groups/2021/08/04/57103eee-f51f-11eb-9738-8395ec2a44e7_story.html) it all comes down to the same basic flaw:

## HRC sacrifices the people it is supposed to represent, seeking a short-term advantage that turns out to be _no advantage at all._

* ENDA did not pass in 2007.

* The Equality Act shows no sign of passage today.

* The politicians who have shown tepid support that HRC endorsed _lost,_ while the fierce allies who could have used their help continue to inspire hope.

HRC has good people in it.  It has trans people in it.  It has brought money, tons of good media work, and some real legal power to help us.  _HRC is not a villain._  But nonetheless something is seriously wrong inside.

I want to see the following changes with HRC:

1. **STOP SACRIFICING REAL PEOPLE FOR PERCEIVED SHORT-TERM POLITICAL GAIN.**

2. Endorse political candidates who _firmly_ support LGBTQ, _even if_ they are less likely to win their election(s) than the establishment candidate.
     
3. Penalize companies with -25 CEI points who donate to politicians harming LGBTQ people.  _It is **insane** that companies like [AT&T, CVS, and Walmart which donate to anti-LGBTQ politicians](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/14/corporations-anti-lgbtq-politicians-donations-study) have a perfect score on the CEI._

4. Change the CEI to only give credit for _actual_ benefits, not "parity" with non-LGBTQ people.  We should not have to guess if credit for something means "Yes we have that as LGBTQ employees" vs "Actually, no one has that".  **A CEI of 100 should really mean something.**

These changes would require top-down support, and would piss off some donors.  Actually accounting for political donations, and benchmarking real benefits, would strip hundreds of companies of their prized 100 CEI score.  It might even make many of them stop participating, or go make their own "Winner of the 2023 JD Power best-in-class LGBTQ benefits package for mid-cap domestics" bullshit award.  So it comes down to this:

## Who is the CEI really for?

Is it for us?  Is it supposed to be a clear signal of who we should be looking to work for, to buy form, to invest in?

Or is it for Wall Street?  Is it a thing for them to check off to make large institutional investors happy with their I&D metrics?

It's up to you HRC.  Who it is -- really -- that you want to help?
