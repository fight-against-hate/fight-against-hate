**For when people try to claim the existence of trans people is a recent phenomenon:**

First person to socially transition was probably some proto-human ancestor. And there are ancient records of people who lived as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, and who pursued whatever physical changes were available to them at the time. Mostly castration (e.g., the Galli, priestesses of the Phrygian goddess Cybele), but sometimes other methods too.

E.g., Ovid wrote an account of the ἐναρής (Eng: enaree or enarei), Scythian shamans who were born male but lived as women, and whom he claimed drank a potion made from distilled urine of a pregnant mare in order to feminize their bodies. This may have actually had some effect - Premarin estrogen supplements are still derived from pregnant mare urine.

For most trans people throughout history, available physical changes would have been limited or non-existent. Some managed to socially transition anyway, either through socially recognized routs in cultures that had such options, or secretly in cultures that didn't.

Examples of people whom we would describe as "trans", who lived in earlier eras:

* [**Elagabalus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus) (204-222) - Roman Emperor who preferred to be called a lady and not a lord, presented as a woman, called herself her lover's queen and wife, and offered vast sums of money to any doctor able to make her anatomically female.
* [**Thomas(ine) Hall**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas(ine\)_Hall) - (1603-unknown) - English servant in colonial Virginia who alternated between presenting as a woman and presenting as a man, before a court ruled that they were both a man and a woman simultaneously, and were required to wear both men's and women's clothing simultaneously.
* [**Chevalier d'Eon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevalier_d%27Eon) (1728-1810) - French diplomat, spy, freemason, and soldier who fought in the Seven Years' War, who transitioned at the age of 49 and lived the remaining 33 years of her life as a woman.

* [**Karl M. Baer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_M._Baer) (1885-1956) - Trans man who underwent reconstructive surgery (the details of which are not known) in 1906, and was legally recognized as male in Germany in 1907.

And while until recently there has been no place in modern US/European culture for people with gender identities and lives atypical to their sex at birth to exist publicly, that isn't true in other times and cultures. Throughout the middle east and Asia there have been [**Hijra**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_%28South_Asia%29) visible in public life for hundreds or even [**thousands**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_%28South_Asia%29#In_the_Mahabharata) of years. The same is true of [**Kathoey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) in Thailand, [**Muxe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxe) in Zapotec culture in Mexico, various [**two-spirit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit) identities found in indigenous American cultures, [**Māhū**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81h%C5%AB) in traditional Hawaiian/Tahitian/Maohi cultures, the [**Fa'afafine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine) of Samoa, Tongan [**Fakaleiti**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakaleiti), the [**Sworn Virgins**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sworn_virgins) of the Balkans, the [**Galli**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli) of Ancient Rome, etc.
