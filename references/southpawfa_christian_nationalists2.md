Two of the groups that spoke were Alliance Defending Freedom & the Family Research Council, led by Tony Perkins.

&#x200B;

There's a great article detailing the most sinister part about these bills, in that they are being written by a few white Christian nationalist groups, such as:

* Alliance Defending Freedom
* Heritage Foundation
* Family Research Council
* American College of Pediatricians
* American Family Association
* Focus on the Family
* Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (aka Project Blitz)
* Christian Voice
* Kelsey Coalition
* Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church
* Family Policy Alliance
* Concerned Women for America
* Liberty Counsel

Just to name a few.

&#x200B;

All of these groups are listed under the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups. **The biggest one right now is Alliance Defending Freedom.**

&#x200B;

In addition to writing the North Carolina bill this year, forcing teachers to oust students who display "gender nonconforming behavior" and not allowing healthcare to our trans community to anyone under 21, over the last 28 years, the Alliance Defending Freedom has defended laws prohibiting:

* ***same-sex intimacy;***
* ***marriage, adoption, and surrogacy for same-sex couples;***
* ***attacked LGBTQ non-discrimination laws, as well as bans on conversion therapy for minors;***
* ***argued in favor of laws that require transgender people to undergo sterilization before legally changing their gender;***
* ***challenged access to contraception; and***
* ***supported the criminalization of abortion at any stage of pregnancy.***

&#x200B;

Its work stretches beyond the United States; ADF has, for instance:

* [***championed***](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/splc-report-dangerous-liaisons.pdf) ***Belize’s archaic anti-sodomy law, which allows for the persecution and imprisonment of gay people.***

&#x200B;

>The ADF’s overarching position on gay people is that they should either be converted to heterosexuality or fired from their jobs and imprisoned because of their sexual orientation. This stance has earned the group a controversial [designation](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom) as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

&#x200B;

>***When GOP state legislators began to push “bathroom bills” in 2016 and 2017, it was ADF that*** [***ghostwrote the model legislation***](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/alliance-defending-freedom-lobbies-anti-lgbt-bathroom-bills/) ***and*** [***lobbied for it behind the scenes***](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/law-firm-linked-anti-transgender-bathroom-bills-across-country-n741106)***.***

&#x200B;

They are all astroturfing under a group named [PromisetoAmerica'sChildren](https://promisetoamericaschildren.org/about-us/).

&#x200B;

9th commandment: Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness, right?

&#x200B;

The [article](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/04/short-history-anti-trans-stuff-came-concerned/) lists out the fact these groups were butt-hurt about losing the gay marriage Obergefell case, and now they are bullish on taking rage against the transgender community in retaliation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

These horrible monsters are just intent to terrorize people in the name of religion.

&#x200B;

The worst part is they have a major lobbying group behind them, basically swaying legislators.

&#x200B;

***The leader of Focus on the Family, James Dobson*** (whom Mike Pence called his inspirational role model), even started an [astroturf group known as the Women's Liberation Front (WOLF)](https://www.transadvocate.com/fake-radical-feminist-group-actually-paid-political-front-for-anti-lgbt-james-dobson-organization_n_20207.htm) for TERFs to basically make it look like a feminist website, even though he's a white evangelical male. These guys bear false witness and think it's okay because it's about stopping *"The Queer Agenda"*.

&#x200B;

These groups all take as White Christian Nationalist Groups their directions from a leader known as RJ Rushdoony, who came up with the idea known as Christian Reconstruction. It seeks to instill Biblical law into government, creating Christian theocracy. Rushdoony had been quoted in saying many things, such as this quote:

>*Fundamentalist Christians must take control of governments and impose strict biblical law on America and the world. That would mean the death penalty for "practicing homosexuals," among many other "abominators."*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Although most fundamentalist leaders now deny holding Reconstructionist beliefs, several — including Beverly and Tim LaHaye (Author of the book series Left Behind & founder of Concerned Women for America), Donald Wildmon (see American Family Association) and D. James Kennedy (see Coral Ridge Ministries) — did serve alongside Rushdoony and other Chalcedon associates on the Coalition for Revival, a group formed in 1981 to "reclaim America."

&#x200B;

These groups have been advocates for conversion therapy, banning of pornography, and have openly stated that LGBTQ+ people are pedophiles that must be stopped.

&#x200B;

* From James Dobson

>"The homosexual agenda is a beast. It wants our kids."

&#x200B;

* From another group, known as the Traditional Values Coalition:

>*"As homosexuals continue to make inroads to the public schools, more children will be molested and indoctrinated into the world of homosexuality.* *Gay-Straight Alliances on high school campuses are also part of a plot to "target children for recruitment" to gay sex, cross-dressing and sex-change operations*."

So, if you ever wonder who is working behind these bills, look no further than these groups. It's just a bunch of Christian Nationalist organizations that want to instill Christian theocracy onto the United States, making everyone swear on the Bible again. These groups are beyond repugnant, and their stances in the past reflect that.
