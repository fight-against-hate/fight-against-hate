**Being trans is not classified as a mental illness:**

Being trans is not classified as a mental illness by either the [**American Psychological Association**](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx) or the [**World Health Organization**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/20/transgender-not-mental-illness-world-health-organization/717758002/). Gender dysphoria or incongruence is recognized by both as a medical condition, and transition is the only treatment recognized as effective and appropriate medical response to this condition. A trans person who has completed transition, and who no longer experiences distress because the conditions previously causing it have been corrected, is no longer diagnosed as having dypshoria or incongruence.

**On claims that the "Swedish Study" shows that transition does not reduce suicide risk:**

The claim that the "Swedish study" shows that transition does not reduce reduce risk of suicide attempts while improving mental health and quality of life is a deliberate misrepresentation  of [**this study by Dr. Dhejne**](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016885). This dishonest twisting of her work was popularized by Paul McHugh, a religious extremist and [**leading member**](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/hate-group-masquerading-as-pediatricians-attacks-transgender-youth-544e755c6a20/) of an anti-gay and anti-trans [**hate group**](http://www.snopes.com/americas-pediatricians-gender-kids/), who presents himself as a reputable source but publishes work without peer review. His claim to fame is having shut down the Johns Hopkins trans health program in the 70's, which he did not based on medical evidence but on his personal ideological opposition to transition. Johns Hopkins has [**resumed offering transition related medical care**](http://transadvocate.com/johns-hopkins-resumes-trans-care_n_19077.htm), including reconstructive surgery, and their faculty are finally [**disavowing**](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-lgbtq-hopkins-20160928-story.html) him for his irresponsible and ideologically motivated misrepresentation of the current science of sex and gender.

Dr. Dhejne had [**emphatically denounced**](http://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) McHugh and his dishonest, unethical misuse of her work. For those who don't trust her interview with the TransAdvocate, she did so again in her [**r/Science AMA in 2017**](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/).

Dr. Dhejne's study wasn't looking at the efficacy of transition related treatment on suicide rates at all. Her study was looking at the long term effects of anti-trans abuse and discrimination.

From the very beginning of the of the study, under Participants:

> Participants: All 324 sex-reassigned persons (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) in Sweden, 1973–2003. *Random population controls (10∶1) were matched by birth year and birth sex or reassigned (final) sex, respectively.*

The comparison being made was between trans people who transitioned between 1973 and 2003, and the control group drawn from the general population. No comparison whatsoever was made between the trans people's risk of suicide attempts before transition vs after.

And her findings were only that trans people who transitioned *prior to 1989* has slightly higher rates of mental illness and risk of suicide attempts as compared to the *general public.* These rates were still far lower than the rates other studies consistently find among trans people prior to transition, and Dr. Dhejne specifically attributed these slightly higher than average rates to the vicious level of discrimination and abuse people who transitioned 30+ years ago were subjected to.

Dr. Dhejne's study found no difference between the rates of suicide attempts or mental illness among trans people who transitioned after 1989, and the general public.

Transition has overwhelmingly proven to be incredibly effective medical treatment, dramatically improving mental health, social functionality, and quality of life, while reducing risk of suicide attempts from 40% down to the national average. When able to transition young, with access to appropriate medical treatment, and when spared abuse and discrimination, trans people are as psychologically healthy as the general public.

From the interview where Dr. Dhejne spells out why your misrepresentation of her study's purpose and results are catastrophically inaccurate, if you're too lazy to read it yourself:

> **Dr. Dhejne:** *The study as a whole covers the period between 1973 and 2003. If one divides the cohort into two groups, 1973 to 1988 and 1989 to 2003,* ***one observes that for the latter group (1989 – 2003), differences in mortality, suicide attempts, and crime disappear.***

...

> ***Of course trans medical and psychological care is efficacious.*** *A 2010 meta-analysis confirmed by studies thereafter show that medical gender confirming interventions reduces gender dysphoria.*

...

> *The aim of trans medical interventions is to bring a trans person’s body more in line with their gender identity, resulting in the measurable diminishment of their gender dysphoria. However trans people as a group also experience significant social oppression in the form of bullying, abuse, rape and hate crimes.* ***Medical transition alone won’t resolve the effects of crushing social oppression: social anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress.***

...

> *What we’ve found is that treatment models which ignore the effect of cultural oppression and outright hate aren’t enough.* ***We need to understand that our treatment models must be responsive to not only gender dysphoria, but the effects of anti-trans hate as well. That’s what improved care means.***
