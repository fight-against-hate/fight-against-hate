**For when people claim "transition regret" is a common and serious problem:**

"Regret" is vanishingly rare. 

Among trans surgical patients, "regret" rates are consistently found to be about 1% and falling. And these "regret" rates include people who are very glad they transitioned, but regret only that surgical error or shitty luck led to sub-optimal surgical results. They may even be glad they got surgery, and their lives greatly improved by it, but regret only that they didn't get the ideal results they were hoping for.

This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment.

And regarding transition as a whole, only about 8% of trans people detransition, and of those who do 62% go on to transition again later - meaning only 3% detransiton permanently. And among those who do detransition, nearly all cited external factors as their reasons for doing - e.g., intolerable levels of anti-trans harassment or discrimination (31%), employment discrimination (29%), and pressure from a parent (36%), spouse (18%), or other family members (26%).

The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, <1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.*
