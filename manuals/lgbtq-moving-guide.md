=======================

Introduction
------------

This guide is intended primarily to support LGBTQ people currently
living in unaccepting areas of the USA who seek to move to those
states that do provide legal protections.  If you live in one of these
states:

    Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
    Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
    Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North
    Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
    Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

...then aim to move to one of these states instead:

    California, Colorado, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Delaware,
    Iowa, Illinois, Massachussetts, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, New
    Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode
    Island, Virgina, Vermont, Washington.

This guide prioritizes the needed components for a successful move as:
employment, medical support, and housing.

For those unable to move, see [this

for some options on self-defense.
