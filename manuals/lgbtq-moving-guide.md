The LGBTQ Movers' Guide
=======================

Introduction
------------

This guide is intended primarily to support LGBTQ people currently
living in unaccepting areas of the USA who seek to move to those
states that do provide legal protections.  If you live in one of these
states:

    Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
    Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
    Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North
    Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
    Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

...then aim to move to one of these states instead:

    California, Colorado, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Delaware,
    Iowa, Illinois, Massachussetts, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, New
    Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode
    Island, Virgina, Vermont, Washington.

This guide prioritizes the needed components for a successful move as:
employment, medical support, and housing.

For those unable to move, see [this
guide](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/blob/master/manuals/lgbtq-benefits-guide.md)
for some options on self-defense.

Those who wish to fight against the passage of new discriminatory laws

Employment
----------

The [Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/) has been collecting
data from employers for many years and produces the [Corporate
Equality
Index](https://www.hrc.org/resources/corporate-equality-index) as a
benchmark for comparison.  In 2021, [767
companies](https://www.hrc.org/resources/best-places-to-work-for-lgbtq-equality-2021)
earned the highest score of 100.  A good rule of thumb for LGBTQ job
seekers is to apply at employers with a score of **85 or higher**.  As
of 2021, 986 companies meet that criteria. [here is the list, sorted
by 2021 CEI
score.](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/blob/master/data/CEI-2021-revised-030121_sorted.csv)
