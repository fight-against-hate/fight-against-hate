The LGBTQ Movers' Guide
=======================

Introduction
------------

This guide is intended primarily to support LGBTQ people currently
living in unaccepting areas of the USA who seek to move to those
states that do provide legal protections.  If you live in one of these
states:

    Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
    Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
    Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North
    Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
    Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

...then aim to move to one of these states instead:

    California, Colorado, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Delaware,
    Iowa, Illinois, Massachussetts, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, New
    Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode
    Island, Virgina, Vermont, Washington.

This guide prioritizes the needed components for a successful move as:
employment, medical support, and housing.

For those unable to move, see [this
guide](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/blob/master/manuals/lgbtq-benefits-guide.md)
for some options on self-defense.

Those who wish to fight against the passage of new discriminatory laws
can reference [this action

to get started.


Employment
----------

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) has been collecting data from
employers for many years and produces the "Corporate Equality Index"
as a benchmark for comparison.  A good rule of thumb for LGBTQ job
seekers is to avoid employers with a score of **80 or lower**.  [Here
is the list, sorted by 2021 CEI
score.](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/blob/master/data/CEI-2021-revised-030121_sorted.csv)
The list sorted by name [is
here.](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/blob/master/data/CEI-2021-revised-030121.csv)

Note that the CEI is easily gamed by employers, and HRC does **not**
apply the -25 CEI penalty to employers that donate to anti-LGBTQ
causes and/or politicians.  One should not assume that a score of 100
in any way means real access to benefits such as trans health care, or
a culture that is truly accepting of LGBTQ people.
