The LGBTQ Guide To A Benefits Package
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This guide is intended primarily to support LGBTQ people living in
unaccepting areas of the USA that do not offer comprehensive legal
protections, mostly the "red" states but also a few others, namely:

    Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
    Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
    Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North
    Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
    Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

In 2021, most of the states listed above began to pass laws to:

* Criminalize or otherwise ban medical care for transgender people.
  Many of these states sought to define such care as felony child
  abuse, with the threat of breaking up families that supported their
  trans children.  Others prohibited health care insurance plans from
  covering care, even to adults.

* Explicitly permit discrimination against all LGBTQ in medical
  services via "religious conscience" bills.

* Ban transgender people (usually women) from using gender-appropriate
  facilities including bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams.
  These laws subject _all_ women to invasive checks of genitals,
  blood, and birth certificate.

* Make it difficult or impossible to amend documentation such as
  identification and birth certificate to reflect a person's gender
  identity.

Many people are unable to move into one of the twenty-one states that
do offer comprehensive legal protections due to employment, family
obligations, and community integration.  Living in a legally hostile
jurisdiction does not mean someone is entirely defenseless.
Discriminatory laws tend to be enforced unevenly, used more as a
weapon against specific people than an effective whole-state ban.

This guide is for those people who have good reasons to stay put, but
want to defend themselves and their loved ones using resources
commonly available.  Becoming a "difficult" target who fights back
will often get the bullies to move on; or gain time for a child to
grow into a legal adult with recognized rights.

For those able to move, see [this

to get started.
