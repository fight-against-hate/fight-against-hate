What You Can Do To Help Stop The Anti-LGBTQ Backlash - Version 2.0
==================================================================

Many of you are asking "What can I do?"  The answer is PLENTY!  Wherever you are, you can help.  Here is a plan.

#Step 1: Awareness

Most people think this is about sports, or saving children from irreversible surgery.  But what these laws really do is _far_ worse than what most people hear:

* The trans sports bans and bathroom bills open up _all_ women -- cis and trans -- to invasive on-demand checks of their genitals, blood, or birth certificate.  (How else can you prove that the woman trying to get on the team or into the "wrong" bathroom isn't trans?)

* The religious bills open up _all_ LGBTQ to having their heath care denied at every step of delivery.  "Sorry, my pastor says gay marriage is a sin, so I won't fill your prescriptions."  "This church-supported hospital system does not perform surgeries for lesbians."  There are huge swaths of this country only served by religious hospitals, and these bills threaten to force LGBTQ to either move to another area or just accept that they might not have access to medicine, even if they can pay for it themselves.

* Most of the trans health care bans criminalize support for trans children as felony child abuse.  Doctors who followed their Hippocratic Oath would lose their license.  Parents who supported their children would have them taken from them and thrown into foster care.  **These bills threaten to break up loving families.**  In any other circumstances we would call this a war crime.

So tell people what these laws really mean!

* Send them [this letter from 1500 parents](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/1-500-parents-of-transgender-non-binary-and-gender-expansive-youth-condemn-anti-trans-bills-in-open-letter-to-lawmakers) describing the ordeal their families are going through.  Forward it to every parent of a trans, non-binary, or gender-expansive child you know to sign also.

* Show them [this map](https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/) so they can see how widespread this attack is.  Or [this simplified version for just the health care bans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/mn284d/map_of_states_that_are_seeking_to_criminalize/)

What if they want to discuss the science?  Well, if they really want to get into the details [here are some references.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/i6ed5z/is_there_scientific_literature_validating_us/)  If they want to dig into the medical side, here in an interesting [video from Dr. Powers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fefu33e8O-0) If they want a broader audience this [short documentary from Real Stories is fantastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B67OVJTyV0I)

OK, so the laws are awful and widespread, and completely against the real science for trans people.  What's next?

Alright, you've done a great job as an individual, now take it to work!

#Step 3: Employees

The workplace is where many of us spend most of our time, even if that work for now is from home due to COVID.  And employers are required by law to provide safe workplaces for everyone regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and many other factors.  Most employers find this not only morally right, but good business: it turns out that employees who feel comfortable being themselves are also more productive and creative, and improve the bottom line.

But as employees we are generally very limited in discussing politics or charity at work by our codes of conduct, which say that politics can only be handled by the corporate office, and soliciting for charity doesn't happen on work time or equipment.  So what can you do?  Plenty!

Before you start down this list, see if your company has a Pride or LGBTQ employee network.  Give this list to them, as they are the appropriate means of getting LGBTQ issues in front of the company's leadership.  If you don't have a group, try at the HR department, or legal.

1. Establish that this is not about politics or charity, this is truly a national-scale _human rights crisis._ They are talking about breaking up families and examining women's genitals!  People are [seriously leaving their home states in search of safety for their families.](https://www.businessinsider.com/arkansas-3-anti-trans-bills-in-3-weeks-triggers-exodus-2021-4)  The effects of these laws will touch _every_ family with LGBTQ in the country.

2. This is widespread and urgent.  You have a _duty_ to your employer to notify them of this issue, since it will impact their customers, their suppliers, and them.  Send them [this letter, currently signed by ~~70~~ ~~74~~ 84 major companies,](https://www.hrc.org/resources/business-statement-on-anti-lgbtq-state-legislation) that clearly spells out how these laws will harm their employees, their competitiveness, and the economy.  Hurting LGBTQ is bad for business.

3. Ask if your employer can sign the letter.  Point out some of the names on it: IBM, Intel, Microsoft, AT&T, Verizon, Wells Fargo, Dow, Bayer, Union Pacific, American Airlines, Pfizer.  These aren't "socially activist" companies:  8 of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average companies are here.  _This is about business._ It turns out that disrupting the lives of up to 5% of a state's workforce might not be the best environment for making money.

4. Also point out that the letter does not call for action against any specific person, government, or political party; nor is it a fundraiser; nor is it asking for social change, it's actually (conservatively) asking for _no_ change.  Under many corporate codes of conduct, this specific letter fits "within the bounds" and can be talked about internally.

So let's say you've done all this, and your employer said no, they won't sign the letter.  Even without the letter, there is _a lot_ they can do to help.  Send them the list below.

#Step 4: Employers

Hello business owner!  You are in a hard place: you have employees and/or dependents who are being targeted and can't work for you at the productivity level you need them to, but you also are not in a position to stick your neck out.  Here are some things you can do -- without broadcasting to the world -- that will make a _real_ difference for your people:

* If you have an employee assistance program, the one with the professional counselors and therapists, make sure it will support anyone who calls into it even after COVID is finished.

* Tell your health insurance provider(s) that they will lose you as a customer if they deny service to your employees based on religious objection.

* Your people will need lawyers to defend themselves if they are targeted.  If you aren't on it already, get on the [MetLife (formerly known as Hyatt) Legal Plan](https://www.metlife.com/insurance/legal-plans/).  Consider covering the premium for your employees, it's usually only about $20 per month.

* If a vulnerable employee can telecommute for you, let them do that.  You've probably already been doing it because of COVID, right?  Give them the freedom to move to safety, so that they don't have to resign in order to protect their family.

* If you have sites in the states that offer comprehensive legal protection for LGBTQ -- namely CA, CO, CT, DC, DE, IA, IL, MA, MD, ME, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OR, RI, VA, VT, WA -- then preferentially invest in those states, and offer transfers to vulnerable employees into those states.

* If you don't have it already, get some LGBTQ training videos into your system.  [Here is a great list](https://www.opensesame.com/lists/detail/665010) of ready-made videos available from OpenSesame if you need something a bit more polished-looking than YouTube.  If you feel that interactive classes would be a better fit than passive videos, then check out [PFLAG's training catalog.](https://www.straightforequality.org/workplace)  _Make this training mandatory._

* Fully commit to being an inclusive workplace, even in areas that are not accepting.  If you can't put a Pride flag outside in June, then have a banner in the cafeteria and hallways.  Tell employees they can wear their Converse Pride sneakers anytime.  Pay for a van and lunch and take some people to the next Pride parade.  Show your people that -- even if you cannot publicly be "branded" a LGBTQ-friendly workplace -- that you do care for them and will support them in this time of need.

* If you've got hateful political radio or talking heads running in your break rooms, turn that off.  Don't give the people who hate your employees a foothold in _your_ workplace.

* If you don't have a Pride/LGBTQ group, start one.

You have tremendous power to help your people.  Please help them now, so that they can continue working for _your_ success.

#Step 5: Join Some Friends

OK, you have shown support, done your duty to your employer and customers, and helped your co-workers.  Well done!

You might be a bit tired now:  this could be a good time to find some friends who can help you breathe.  Or maybe you find yourself fired up and ready to continue for the long haul, but need to do so in a more structured fashion.  Either way, let's connect you to some people who have solid experience in this.

I have already mentioned [Human Rights Campaign](https://hrc.org), [ACLU](https://aclu.org), [Lambda Legal](https://www.lambdalegal.org/), and [National Center For Transgender Equality](https://transequality.org/).  They are all awesome.  But here are a couple more that might be great for you:

* Find real people to talk to through [PFLAG](https://pflag.org/).  They likely have a [chapter near you](https://pflag.org/find-a-chapter), but given COVID they could be meeting remotely right now -- which might be even better for you.  The [newsletter](https://pflag.salsalabs.org/signup/index.html) is good, and if you want that structured fight then check out [Advocacy 101.](https://pflag.org/advocacy-101)

* If you've got some talent in media, you may find [GLAAD](https://www.glaad.org/) to be an awesome teacher and outlet.  I know there are a ton of energetic writers, poets, performers, and artists around here.  Give it some thought.

We are nearing the end of _this_ plan.  Now I invite you to make an even better plan.

#Final Step: Make This Better

I am just a volunteer in Pride who happened to be stuck in the hot seat when this national crisis erupted.  But just as all of you would for yours, I will defend everyone that I joyfully call my family.

I missed out on a ton of stuff people will need.  [Would you be able to help fill us in?](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate)

Everyone is welcome, but there is one rule above all: **We work only for acceptance and the right to live in peace.** We will not support anything that could lead to physical harm to someone else.

[The vast majority of America does not want these bills.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/new-poll-shows-americans-overwhelmingly-oppose-anti-transgender-laws)  Sadly, this is _all_ just a [few rich buttheads](https://www.outfrontmagazine.com/a-hate-group-is-reportedly-fighting-to-pass-anti-trans-bills/) trying to break the entire country.

Anyway, here are some things you could help on:

* Where can we find temporary housing arrangements for both individuals and families?  Sometimes these are called "rapid response" items.  If you know of any, comment [over here](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/discussions/2).  Let's make a shared list people in trouble can refer to.

* How do we ensure medical support for children is not interrupted?  Many providers will see anyone who can physically get to them, but will they treat minors?  How about minors from states that have criminalized their care?  Again, comment [over here](https://github.com/fight-against-hate/fight-against-hate/discussions/3) and let's build a community list.

Collectively, we have everything we need to win this struggle.  And I know, I _absolutely_ know, that we will win out.

#My Message To The Haters

You have the statehouses, you have unlimited money, and you have unlimited hate fueling your rage.  But guess what?

_You are going to lose._

We are here and not backing down.  Those of us in safe places will make room to shelter those who must -- for now -- flee from you.  Some of us will fall and you will rejoice.  But your victories, as daunting as they are right now, will not last.

We are a family.  A cantankerous, raucous rabble of every color and every culture and every career.  We argue, we fight, we are very hard to herd in a common direction, but in the end we have each other.  More than that, we have ourselves.  Our lives, our histories figuring out who we really are, and the absolute certainty that nothing less than our true selves will do.  **Our true selves: that will be enough to beat you.**

We survived the police crackdowns.  We survived AIDS.  We defeated Don't Ask Don't Tell.  We got marriage equality.

**_However long it takes, we will win this one too._**

The day will come when you look around and _everyone_ you know has a trans friend, knows a gay friend, has a non-binary child.  And your friends will tell you that LGBTQ are just normal regular people, and why would anyone be so small that it would feel good to hurt them?

"Live and let live," that's what your friends will say.

And one day, you will agree with them.  And then _all_ of us -- even you -- will win.

💗
